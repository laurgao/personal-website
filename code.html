						<p>Code is the language of the future. Gotta jump on that train early. Don't wanna get left behind. 3 weeks ago, I made a committment to spend 2 hours per day on learning to code. With little prior experience, I went through multiple online courses and took lots of notes. Finished HTML/CSS last week and finished python basics, and this website is my first legit code project :D Next step: learn how to use javascript with web dev + learn more advanced python. Which modules should I learn tho...</p>
